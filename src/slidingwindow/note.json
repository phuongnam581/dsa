- Sliding Window maintains a contiguous subarray
- Key Concept:
    Window: A contiguous subarray
    Left/Right Pointer: Defines boundaries of window
    Expand: Move right pointer to include more elements
    Contract: Move left pointer to exclude elements
- Types of Sliding Window
    Fixed Size Window: The window size remains constant throughout the algorithm.
    Variable Size Window: The window size changes based on conditions:
        Expandable: Window can grow indefinitely until a condition is met
        Shrinkable: Window shrinks when a condition is violated
